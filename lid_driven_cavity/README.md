# Lid Driven Cavity

## Background
The lid-driven-cavity problem is one of the most important benchmarks for computational fluid dynamic (CFD) solvers. 
Its importance results from the fundamental rectangular or square geometry and the simple driving of the flow by means of the tangential motion with constant velocity of a single lid, representing Dirichlet boundary conditions. 
Moreover, the driven-cavity flow exhibits a number of interesting physical features.
